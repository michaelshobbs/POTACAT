# Digital Modes — Unified View Plan

Status: planning (not started)
Filed: 2026-05-08
Scope: desktop, ECHOCAT Web, ECHOCAT iOS

The JTCAT/FT8 popout (desktop) + FT8 screen (iOS) + FT8 view (ECHOCAT Web) become **the** digital-modes UI. Mode is a setting inside the view, not a separate window. One audio capture, one waterfall, one PTT route, one set of macros, one mobile screen. Switching from FT8 to PSK31 is a tab click, not an app navigation.

The window is conceptually renamed **JTCAT — Digital Modes**. Existing FT8/FT4/FT2 mode buttons at the top extend into a full mode bar.

## Window anatomy (shared shell, mode-specific panes)

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Mode bar

The buttons that exist today for FT8/FT4/FT2 grow to FT8/FT4/FT2/JS8/PSK31/RTTY. Active mode is highlighted. Clicking a mode:

1. Stops the current engine (decode worker, TX synth).
2. Wires up the new engine.
3. Swaps the RX and TX panes (DOM-level swap; both pre-rendered, just `display: none` toggled).
4. Updates the speed/variant picker if the mode has variants.
5. Updates the rig mode via the existing `rig-utils.js` mapping (already wired for all six modes).
6. Persists the choice in `settings.jtcatLastMode` so reopen lands on the same mode.

### Speed/variant picker

Only appears when the mode has variants:

| Mode | Variants |
|---|---|
| FT8 | (none) |
| FT4 | (none) |
| FT2 | (none) |
| JS8 | Slow (6.25) / Normal (12.5) / Fast (25) / Turbo (50) baud |
| PSK31 | PSK31 / PSK63 / PSK125 |
| RTTY | 45.45 / 75 / 100 baud, 170 / 425 / 850 Hz shift |

For modes without variants the picker hides.

### Shared waterfall

The existing JTCAT waterfall (`popoutAnalyser` + canvas at 0–3000 Hz) handles all six modes — same audio passband, same FFT. Mode-specific:

- **FT8/FT4/FT2/JS8**: RX marker = decode passband target. TX marker = where outgoing slot will land.
- **PSK31/RTTY**: RX marker = audio center we're tracking (clicking the waterfall at a station's signal sets the center). TX marker = same; PSK/RTTY transmit at the same audio frequency they receive on.

Marker rendering already supports independent RX/TX positions, so this works with no waterfall changes.

### RX pane (mode-specific)

Two layout styles, switchable via `display:none`:

**Slot-based modes (FT8 / FT4 / FT2 / JS8)** — existing JTCAT decode list:
- Per-slot rows: timestamp, SNR, DT, freq, message
- Click a station's callsign to engage / start QSO state machine
- Filter chips: CQ-only, watchlist, needed entities

**Continuous modes (PSK31 / RTTY)** — scrolling text:
- Top region: scrolling decoded characters as they arrive
- Selectable text → click to copy to TX or to log fields
- Optional multi-station view: PSK can decode several stations in the passband; tabs per detected callsign
- Right-click a callsign in the stream to populate the LOG dialog

**JS8 hybrid** — slot list + conversation thread:
- Top: slot decode list (same as FT8)
- Bottom of RX pane: conversation thread for the currently-engaged station (chat-bubble layout). Switching engaged stations swaps the thread.

### TX pane (mode-specific)

**FT8/FT4/FT2** (existing): message templates (`CQ K3SBP FN20`, `K3ABC RR73`, etc.), Auto-Seq button, slot-aware "TX next slot" toggle, cycle countdown.

**JS8**: free-text input box (max ~140 chars per frame). Macros: Heartbeat, CQ, ACK, MSG, Beacon. "Directed to" dropdown — when set, TX is prefixed `@K3ABC ` for the selected station. Frame-count indicator showing how many transmission cycles the message will take at the current speed.

**PSK31/RTTY**: TX text buffer (multi-line), live cursor showing where the encoder currently is in the stream. Macros bar (`CQ`, `name`, `QTH`, `73`, `BTU`). Send button enters the buffer into the TX queue; PTT keys, encoder runs through the queue, drops PTT when buffer empties (or on a stop button).

The DOM for all three TX panes is pre-rendered and swapped on mode change.

### Shared footer

RX gain, TX power, Hold TX Freq toggle, audio device selector, settings gear — all the controls that already exist below the JTCAT TX area, unchanged. They apply to whichever engine is currently active.

## Architecture (engine swapping in the same shell)

### Single engine factory

```js
// lib/digital-modes-engine.js (new)
function createEngine(mode, opts) {
  switch (mode) {
    case 'FT8':
    case 'FT4':
    case 'FT2':
      return new Ft8Engine({ ...opts, mode });   // existing
    case 'JS8':
      return new Js8Engine(opts);                 // new (Phase 3-4)
    case 'PSK31':
      return new PskEngine(opts);                 // new (Phase 2)
    case 'RTTY':
      return new RttyEngine(opts);                // new (Phase 1)
  }
}
```

All engines implement the same interface:
- `start()` / `stop()`
- `feedAudio(samples)` — same shape Ft8Engine uses
- `setTxMessage(text)` — composer hands off here
- Events: `decode` (slot or character), `tx-status`, `silent`

The existing `jtcat-manager.js` becomes mode-agnostic — it owns the active engine and routes audio + lifecycle. Per-slice (multi-decoder) work continues to apply.

### Mode-specific decode workers

```
lib/
  ft8-engine.js          existing
  js8-engine.js          new (Phase 3+)
  js8-worker.js          new (Phase 3+) — uses native LDPC/Costas
  js8_native/            new (Phase 3+) — C++ codec, mirrors ft8_native
  psk-engine.js          new (Phase 2) — pure-JS, runs inline
  rtty-engine.js         new (Phase 1) — pure-JS, runs inline
```

PSK and RTTY don't need workers — their decode CPU is tiny (~1–2% per channel). FT8/FT4/FT2 keep their existing worker. JS8 needs a worker because of LDPC.

### Audio capture stays shared

The existing JTCAT capture chain (`getUserMedia` → `popoutAudioCtx` → `popoutRxGainNode` → `popoutAnalyser` + AudioWorklet) feeds whatever engine is active. The worklet posts samples; the popout decides which engine receives them based on `currentMode`. No new audio infrastructure.

The PSK/RTTY engines accept the same 12 kHz sample stream; they internally decimate/filter to their working rate (8 kHz or even narrower for PSK31's tone-tracking PLL).

### Settings persistence

```
settings.jtcatLastMode       'FT8' | 'FT4' | 'FT2' | 'JS8' | 'PSK31' | 'RTTY'
settings.jtcatLastVariant    per-mode last-selected variant
settings.jtcatRxGain         already exists
settings.jtcatHoldTxFreq     already exists
settings.js8HeartbeatEnabled (new, Phase 4)
settings.js8DefaultSpeed     (new, Phase 4)
settings.pskAudioCenter      default 1500 Hz (new, Phase 2)
settings.rttyShift           default 170 Hz (new, Phase 1)
```

## ECHOCAT (Web + iOS) — same unification

The browser ECHOCAT FT8 view (`renderer/remote.html` / `remote.js`) and the iOS `Ft8Screen.tsx` get the same mode bar at the top. Same swap-pane shape. Mobile picks decoded data from new WS message types:

```
S2C (server → client)
  digital-mode-set       which mode the desktop is in (the desktop is source of truth)
  digital-decode         { mode, … } — slot decode (FT8/FT4/JS8) OR character batch (PSK/RTTY)
  digital-tx-status      { mode, state, message? }
  digital-spectrum       same as today's jtcat-spectrum

C2S (client → server)
  digital-mode-set       mobile asks desktop to switch modes
  digital-tx             { mode, message, freq? }
  digital-tx-stop
  digital-set-variant    speed / shift / etc.
```

The existing `jtcat-decode-batch`, `jtcat-status`, `jtcat-tx-status` messages stay (FT8 family is the most common) but get a `mode` field; new messages cover the new cases. Backwards-compatible.

The iOS app's existing FT8 screen subscribes to the new `digital-decode` channel; per-mode rendering branches inside the screen. Single screen, same pattern.

## Reused infrastructure (already done)

- **Rig tune mappings** — `lib/rig-utils.js` routes all six modes correctly.
- **Spot table** — PSK31/RTTY/JS8 filter chips + Digital (all) preset.
- **DX cluster mode inference** — recognizes PSK31/RTTY/JS8 in comment text.
- **CW_DIGI_MODES** — license-privilege check covers all six.
- **ADIF logging** — `saveQsoRecord` accepts arbitrary mode strings; broadcasts to mobile on save.

## Per-mode technical brief

### RTTY (Baudot 45.45)
AFSK at mark=2125 / space=1955 (170 Hz shift). Mark/space tone detection via Goertzel filters at the two frequencies, edge detect on start bit, sample 5 data bits at symbol-period midpoints, track LTRS/FIGS shift state. ~200 LOC. TX is two-tone FSK; trivial generation. Reference: fldigi RTTY source.

### PSK31 (and PSK63 / PSK125)
BPSK at 31.25/62.5/125 baud, 1500 Hz audio center, ±15 Hz wide. Costas/PLL phase tracking per symbol period, threshold the cumulative phase shift, decode through varicode (variable-length self-synchronizing prefix code). ~300–400 LOC. TX synth is cosine-windowed BPSK; ~150 LOC. References: fldigi, jspsk.

### JS8Call
4-FSK derived from FT8 — Costas-array sync at slot start, payload, CRC, LDPC FEC. Slot length depends on speed (Normal = 15s like FT8, Slow = 30s, Fast = 10s, Turbo = 6s). Native addon for the LDPC + Costas decoder (mirrors `lib/ft8_native`); pure-JS would CPU-spike on busy bands. The directed-message and conversation layer is the bigger UX piece — `@CALLSIGN MSG`, heartbeat, beacon, relay. Source: github.com/js8call/js8call.

## Phasing

### Phase 1 — RTTY inside the unified shell

Smallest mode, simplest DSP, tests the engine-swapping pattern.

- Add RTTY to mode bar (desktop + iOS + web)
- `lib/rtty-engine.js` (~400 LOC)
- RX text-stream pane (new, reused for PSK in Phase 2)
- TX buffer + macros pane (new, reused for PSK)
- Engine factory + swap logic in jtcat-popout
- ECHOCAT new message types: `digital-mode-set`, `digital-decode` (text variant), `digital-tx`, `digital-tx-status`
- iOS handoff: add RTTY tab to FT8 screen + character-stream subview

Delivers: end-to-end RTTY RX+TX via desktop and iOS.

Estimated: 3 sessions, ~1200 LOC desktop, ~400 LOC iOS handoff spec.

### Phase 2 — PSK31

- Add PSK31 to mode bar
- `lib/psk-engine.js` (~600 LOC)
- Reuses Phase 1's text-stream pane
- Click-to-tune-audio-center on the waterfall
- Variant picker (PSK31/63/125)
- iOS handoff: enable PSK31 in the same Digital Modes screen

Estimated: 2 sessions, ~700 LOC desktop.

### Phase 3 — JS8Call RX

- Native codec build (`lib/js8_native/`)
- `lib/js8-engine.js` (~600 LOC JS shell over native)
- JS8 added to mode bar
- Slot list pane (reuses FT8 slot list with mode-aware rendering)
- Speed picker
- ECHOCAT: extend `digital-decode` for JS8 slot batches
- CI: native addon build for JS8 mirrors ft8_native (windows-2022 pin already done)

Estimated: 4 sessions, ~400 LOC native, ~600 LOC JS, ~400 LOC popout.

### Phase 4 — JS8Call TX + messaging

- Encoder + native LDPC encode side
- Free-text composer + macros (Heartbeat, CQ, ACK, MSG, Beacon)
- Conversation thread pane (chat layout, swaps with engaged station)
- Heartbeat scheduler (auto-TX every N minutes when enabled)
- Directed-message protocol: `@CALLSIGN MSG`, parse incoming directed frames, push notification (mobile) when one arrives
- iOS handoff: chat-style conversation view

Estimated: 4 sessions, ~800 LOC desktop, ~500 LOC iOS handoff spec.

### Phase 5 — Polish + multi-station decode

- PSK31 multi-decoder: scan the entire passband, decode multiple concurrent BPSK streams, tab UI per station
- RTTY waterfall fine-tune (click to land on the mark tone exactly)
- ECHOCAT bandwidth optimization: text-stream throttling for slow links
- ADIF SUBMODE field for "PSK31"/"PSK63" granularity (separate from MODE = "PSK")

Estimated: 2–3 sessions.

## Risks and tradeoffs

1. **Window real estate.** The unified shell has to fit FT8's slot list, PSK's text stream, AND JS8's chat. Pre-rendered DOM with `display:none` toggles handles it; total weight is fine.
2. **JS8Call native build.** Same risk profile as ft8_native — MSVC variable-length-array workarounds, the windows-2022 CI pin we already have. Manageable but slow.
3. **Audio device contention.** Solved at engine-swap time: stop the previous engine cleanly before starting the new one. Same pattern as today's FT8↔FT4 switch.
4. **Branding.** "JTCAT" historically meant WSJT family. Adding PSK31/RTTY stretches the name. Default: keep "JTCAT — Digital Modes" in window title; no code symbol churn.
5. **iOS surface area growth.** A single Digital Modes screen with five+ modes inside it gets dense. The iOS team may want a master/detail pattern: top-level mode picker → per-mode subview. Worth a conversation in the Phase 1 handoff.
6. **Scope creep — SSTV.** SSTV is also "digital" but its workflow (image upload, manual TX, no QSO automation) is unlike the others. Keep SSTV in its own popout; do not absorb it into the Digital Modes shell.

## Sequencing

Ship Phase 1 (RTTY) first as the proof of the unified-shell architecture. Once engine-swap, mode-bar, pane-toggle, and ECHOCAT-protocol-extension patterns are settled, Phase 2 (PSK31) is mechanical reuse. JS8 stays last because it's the heaviest piece and benefits from the patterns being settled first.
